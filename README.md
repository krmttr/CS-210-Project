# CS-210-Project

**CS 210 Introduction to Data Science Course Project**
**Fall 2023-24**

## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for our CS 210 Introduction to Data Science course project, conducted during the Fall semester of 2023-24 at Sabanci University. This project explores the relationship between physical activity and sleep quality using personal health data.

## Project Description

In this project, I aim to investigate the hypothesis that daily physical activity levels have a significant impact on sleep quality. To do so, I have utilized Apple Health data as our primary data source, focusing on sleep patterns and activity metrics.

## Repository Contents

- **Notebooks:** This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for exploratorydata analysis, machine learning models, and visualization.

- **Data:** The data folder contains the necessary datasets, including Apple Health data in CSV format.

- **Results:** In this directory, you'll find the project's results, including visualizations and findings.

- **Documentation:** This section includes project documentation, including README files and any additional project-related documents.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the notebooks, data, and results in this repository to gain insights into the relationship between physical activity and sleep quality. You can run the notebooks on your local machine for a detailed analysis.
