# CS-210-Project

**CS 210 Introduction to Data Science Course Project**
**Fall 2023-24**

## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for my CS 210 Introduction to Data Science course project, conducted during the Fall semester of 2023-24 at Sabanci University. This project explores the relationship between physical activity and sleep quality using personal health data.

## Project Description

In this project, I aim to investigate the hypothesis that daily physical activity levels have a significant impact on sleep quality. To do so, I have utilized Apple Health data as my primary data source, focusing on sleep patterns and activity metrics.

## Repository Contents

- **Notebook:** This directory contains a Jupyter notebook used for exploratorydata analysis, machine learning models, and visualization.

- **Data:** The data folder contains the necessary datasets, including Apple Health data in CSV format. (Data file is ignored by using .gitignore)

- **Results:** You'll find the project's results in Jupyter Notebook, including visualizations and findings.

- **Documentation:** There is a PDF file that contains infographic based on results of this project.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the notebooks, data, and results in this repository to gain insights into the relationship between physical activity and sleep quality. Please do not send messages to use my personal data, it will not be allowed!
